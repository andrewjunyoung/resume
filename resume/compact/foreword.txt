Hi,

Before you start reading my resume, I'd like to get in a foreword.

I believe that the arc of my professional progress is most visible by seeing the
ideas that connect the different projects I've worked on.

Given that, I want to show my resume in the context of my skills, and what I can
achieve with them. I aim to present my work in a way that highlights
progression, and my belief that my competitiveness as a technologist comes
from my eye for design, communication, and a high standard of work.

With that in mind, let me walk you through my experience.
