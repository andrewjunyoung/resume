Palantir is a dynamic and innovative company. Its innovations in security and artificial intelligence are world leading. I believe my background in mathematics and computing places me well for contributing in these fields, and I hope to build on the incredible work Palantir has already done. In an ever-changing environment like Palantir, I believe that my strengths in self-reflection, communication, and management will become increasingly important, in complement to my ability as a software developer.

Furthermore, I believe that security has never had a more important role in the world, and innovating solutions to the security problems we see in our systems now will shape the future of technology, its role in society, and how it is used to better human lives. For a business like Palantir, this is an opportunity to solve hard problems for clients that will affect the entire technology industry as a whole.
