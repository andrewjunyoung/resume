Programming encourages those who do it to solve difficult problems, explain ideas clearly, and work with the future in mind -- these are doubtlessly the reasons I enjoy it. Computing in finance has transformed the industry and continues to do so, with groundbreaking projects such as movement onto blockchain. It is this which draws me to the financial industry, and to financial technology in particular.
Taking a degree in mathematics and computer science has above all given me the skills to link ideas. This comes firstly in my approach to computing problems, in searching for clear and concise mathematical solutions to problems, but also in searching for links in other areas. The role of computing in finance has been of great interest to me, firstly through algorithmic trading using techniques such as machine learning, about which I wrote a research paper, and more recently with the adoption of blockchain technology and its potential to make finance more operationally efficient in the years ahead, which I believe will be the most significant change to finance in the coming years. Through working on a project to algorithmically trade cryptocurrencies, I learned both about working on large projects, and about finance. The project has forced me to overcome both computer science problems, and methodically planning, testing, and developing trading algorithms.
At Goldman Sachs, I would have the opportunity to work at the forefront of financial technology, alongside others which share my same passion for computing and finance. The global focus, along with a dynamic and collaborative environment of Goldman Sachs is one I believe I would thrive in.
Computing has and will continue to make change in finance. I want to drive this change.
