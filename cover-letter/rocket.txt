My proudest achievement is launching a high powered H-class rocket with friends in my final year of high school.

The project began as a discussion with my friends about our ambitions for final year, and quickly turned into a devoted effort to design and build our own rocket. I am proud of our team because of the challenge before us. We encountered a huge number of setbacks, including an entire materials redesign of the rocket, but in the face of every one of these, refused to give up, and pushed forward to the project's completion. The construction was an unprecedented logistical challenge for us in researching and then sourcing materials, designing, and performing safety checks on our rocket without external supervision.

The project to me always walks the line of the unimaginable and the crazy. The ultimate success of the launch was a testiment to the effort we put into its construction, and all the challenges overcome in making it. We were self-funded, self-run, and self-motivated, and all of these resulted in the accomplishment that came from the launch. The incredibly complex emotions I felt at the sound of the launch are something I will carry with me for the rest of my life.
